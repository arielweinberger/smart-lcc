# Smart LCC

A smarter LCC for the Lelit Bianca, with Wi-Fi and stuff.

Based on the protocol dissection I'm doing in [magnusnordlander/lelit-bianca-protocol](https://github.com/magnusnordlander/lelit-bianca-protocol).

## Project goals

Create a smart replacement for the "LCC" PID module used in the Lelit Bianca with open source hardware and software.

## Architecture

This project is using the Arduino RP2040 Connect, a dual core ARM Cortex-M0+ board with a Ublox Nina W102 module.

## Status

This is not yet ready. At all.
